# DAND project 4: Wrangle and Analyze Data

This is a project from the course [Data Analyst Nanodegree - Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).
This repository contains a single pdf file with SQL comands used, observations and some conclusions.

Right now I am not sure how others can contribute to this.
However, suggestion are welcome.
